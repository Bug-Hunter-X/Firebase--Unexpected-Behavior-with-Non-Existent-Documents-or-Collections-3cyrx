The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a document or collection that doesn't exist, particularly when using asynchronous operations.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. For example, using `getDoc()` on a non-existent document will resolve with a `null` document, which isn't explicitly an error, but leads to runtime errors if you don't handle it properly.  Similarly, using `getDocs()` on a collection containing no documents will return an empty array, which might not be explicitly treated as an error.
